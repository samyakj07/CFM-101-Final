Strategies:

Depict the portfolio weighting based on the index (S&P), i.e. use close sector weighting relative to the index instead of flooding one sector.

Use big diversified companies

For the weighting, keep it equally weighted in the beginning, then we can shift it accordingly

Using yfinance, we can use historical data for beta to estimate each stock’s beta; if they are less than or more than 1, shift accordingly.

Avoid penny stocks because they don’t move well with the market.
